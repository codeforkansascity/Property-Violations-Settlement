The city provides the [code violation data through its open data portal](https://data.kcmo.org/Housing/Property-Violations/nhtf-e75a). The range of things you can do with the data through the portal is tremendous. You can sort, filter, query and export it in a variety of formats. You can also access definitions for each field/column by hovering over the column header.

The property violations project is set up to pull the data from the city's portal programmatically using R scripts and provides a rich range of utility functions for analyzing the data.
