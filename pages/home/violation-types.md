##  Two Categories: Nuisance and Property Maintenance

Code violations relating to real property can be broken down into two main classes:
nuisances and property maintenance violations. Broadly speaking, nuisances relate to the
property itself, while property maintenance violations tend to relate to structures or
improvements on the property.

[The city's website lists the following common examples of nuisances and property maintenance violations](http://kcmo.gov/neighborhoods/neighborhood-preservation/common-code-violations/):

| TYPE | DESCRIPTION |
|------|-------------|
| Nuisance | Litter, trash and rubbish |
| Nuisance | Rank weeds and grass |
| Nuisance | Fallen limbs or brush from greenery |
| Nuisance | Open/inappropriate storage of items such as interior furniture outdoors |
| Nuisance | Parking in unapproved location or without proper license |
| Nuisance | Graffiti |
| Nuisance | Hazardous tree or limbs |
| Property Maintenance | Peeling, cracked or blistered paint |
| Property Maintenance | Damaged siding |
| Property Maintenance | Exterior not protected from weather |
| Property Maintenance | Building not secured against unauthorized entry |
| Property Maintenance | Broken, cracked or missing windows |
| Property Maintenance | Gutters, eaves, soffits or fascia boards in disrepair |
| Property Maintenance | Fence or retaining wall in disrepair |
| Property Maintenance | Failure to register vacant property |
| Property Maintenance | Failure to register rental property |

## Multiple Ways to Categorize Code Violations

While the two main categories of code violations help to understand the violations broadly, there is much more to the story. As described in [Data Structure](/data-structure), there are four different fields on each record that describe a violation. From the most general to the most specific, these are: Ordinance Chapter, Ordinance Number, Ordinance Code and Ordinance Description. How best to use these different ways of categorizing violations is one of the topics analyzed by the project.
