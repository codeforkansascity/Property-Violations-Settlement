Kansas City has led the way in opening up city data for analysis. This site focuses on one particular trove: information on violations of city codes relating to real property.

Code violations encompass a large range of problems: from overgrown weeds and trash dumping to structural issues when property is not properly maintained. The [CodeForKC property violations project](https://github.com/codeforkansascity/Property-Violations-Settlement)
mines the code violations data for insights and considers ways to use the data.
